                p Founder and CTO of Maritimetrainer, Java Backend Developer
                p I am passionate about Developer Experience, Digital Transformation, Process Engineering, Open Source, and Java. I love finding new tools and learning how they solve problems in beautiful ways. I also enjoy spending time learning about what people are working on and what they are passionate about. I will take any opportunity to throw ideas on a table (or post-its on a wall) and explore what we come up with to see if we can identify real problems and high-quality solutions.
